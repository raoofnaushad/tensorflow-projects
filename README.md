# Materials For Tensorflow Certification

This repo is handbook of work I have prepared for Tensorflow Certification Program. 

## Tensorflow Certification Programme
Tensorflow developer certification program is a certification program conducted by Tensorflow. This certification can be taken by students, developers, scientist and all machine learning enthusiast. It helps us to demonstrate the practical machine learning, deep learning skills. It checks your expertise in practical machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing techniques. If you qualified and certified you can demonstrate the certification in resume, GitHub and all other social media platforms.
